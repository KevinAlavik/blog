Welcome to **shittydev.com**, a blog dedicated to programmingâ€”mostly low-level stuff. Here, you'll find posts about operating system development, assembly, and other intricate details of coding that dive deep into how things work under the hood.

Most of the posts are written by [Kevin Alavik](https://github.com/KevinAlavik). If you want to learn more about me and my journey in programming, check out the [About](/about) page.
