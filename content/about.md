## Introduction

Hey there! I’m Kevin, a programmer from Sweden with a deep interest in low-level programming. While I often say I’m focused on low-level stuff, my journey in the world of coding has been pretty diverse—from simple web development to the complexities of operating system development.

## My Journey into Programming

I’ve been programming for about seven years if you count HTML and Scratch as programming. Otherwise, it’s been around five years. My programming journey started with creating simple games on Scratch. Those early experiences were a lot of fun and sparked my curiosity about how software works. After that, I moved on to game development using Unity and C#, which deepened my interest in software development.

## Transition to Web Development

After getting into game development, I decided to explore web development. I worked on some basic websites, which helped me build a solid foundation in coding. This phase was important because it taught me how different parts of software interact and work together, giving me a better understanding of programming as a whole.

## Experimenting with Different Languages

Over the years, I’ve dabbled in various programming languages. I’ve done small projects in Python, TypeScript, and a few others, just to get a feel for different tools and approaches. At one point, I even tried to develop my own programming language, which was a pretty ambitious project. Unfortunately, it didn’t go as planned, and I ended up getting really burnt out. I lost my motivation for programming and took a break from coding for about a year.

## Rediscovering My Passion with Low-Level Programming

When I decided to get back into programming, I started small by learning C—a language that’s known for being both powerful and challenging. Around this time, I also started exploring the world of OS development again. I had dabbled in osdev before, following some questionable osdev tutorials, where I played around with simple BIOS interrupts. But what really reignited my interest was a challenge from a friend of mine, who went by the name "glomdom".

Around this time, I became fascinated with the 8086 CPU, which played a key role in the development of modern computing. The 8086 is an iconic processor introduced by Intel in 1978, marking the beginning of the x86 architecture. It features a 16-bit architecture with a powerful instruction set, and it laid the groundwork for the 32-bit and later 64-bit versions of the x86 architecture. I found myself deeply intrigued by how it handled tasks, its efficiency, and its influence on subsequent processors.

This fascination with the 8086 naturally led me to fall in love with the broader x86 architecture, especially the x86_64 variant. The more I learned about it, the more I wanted to explore and understand every detail. I even tried my hand at writing emulators for various CPUs like the 6502, 8080, and 8086. Although those attempts didn’t go as smoothly as I’d hoped—I failed pretty big—the process taught me a lot.

Thanks to "glomdom" pushing me, I decided to give osdev a serious shot. This time, I turned to the osdev wiki and the osdev discord server, where I found a supportive community and a wealth of resources.

## Current Focus

These days, I mainly use C and assembly, though I sometimes work with C++ depending on the project. My current focus is on two projects: [Sphynx](https://github.com/sphynxos/sphynx), an operating system I’m developing, and [sphynxboot](https://github.com/sphynxsboot), its bootloader. These projects allow me to dive deep into low-level programming, especially within the x86_64 architecture that I’ve grown to love.

Working on various operating systems (such as Sphynx and sphynxboot) has been incredibly rewarding. Through this journey, I’ve made many friends in the osdev community—people I truly appreciate and look up to. They’ve made this challenging but fun journey even more worthwhile. I’m excited to see where these projects will take me and how I’ll continue to grow as a programmer.

## Goodbye

Thank you for taking the time to read about my journey. I’m looking forward to what lies ahead, and I hope to continue learning, growing, and sharing my experiences with you all.
